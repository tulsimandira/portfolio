        <h1>Customer Analysis Dashboard</h1>
        <p class="lead">A comprehensive and interactive analysis of customer purchasing behavior, revenue, and sales patterns.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Customer Analysis Dashboard provides an in-depth look at customer purchasing patterns, sales trends, and revenue generation across 
            various dimensions. Built using Tableau, it enables businesses to uncover actionable insights and make data-driven decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dashboard allows users to explore data across <strong>15 categories</strong>: Appliances, Beauty & Grooming, Books, Computing, Entertainment, 
            Health & Sports, Home & Living, Kids & Baby, Men’s Fashion, Mobiles & Tablets, Others, School & Education, Soghaat, Superstore, and Women’s Fashion.
        </p>

        <h2>Insights from the Dashboard</h2>

        <h3>Month-Wise Revenue</h3>
        <p>
            The month-wise revenue trend highlights seasonal variations in sales performance. Peaks are observed in December, driven by holiday shopping, 
            and April, likely due to spring promotions. Off-peak months like January and July provide opportunities to boost sales through targeted campaigns.
        </p>

        <h3>Revenue per State</h3>
        <p>
            A heatmap visualizes state-level revenue contributions. States like California, Texas, and New York show the highest revenue, while states 
            such as Alaska and Vermont contribute less, indicating potential areas for market expansion.
        </p>

        <h3>Region-Wise Revenue Share</h3>
        <p>
            The pie chart reveals revenue distribution across regions. The South leads with 38.37% of total revenue, followed by the Midwest at 26.93%. 
            The West and Northeast have lower contributions, highlighting areas to focus on for future growth.
        </p>

        <h3>Gender-Wise Sales Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            This chart divides sales revenue by gender and category. Female customers significantly drive revenue in Women’s Fashion and Beauty & Grooming, 
            while male customers dominate Mobiles & Tablets and Appliances. Balanced contributions are seen in Books and School & Education.
        </p>

        <h3>Age-Wise Revenue</h3>
        <p>
            The age-wise revenue chart shows that customers aged 30-40 contribute the most revenue, followed by those aged 60-70. Younger customers (<20) 
            and older customers (>70) have lower contributions, providing insights into demographic-specific marketing strategies.
        </p>

        <h3>Quantity-Discount Correlation</h3>
        <p>
            The scatter plot analyzes how discounts impact purchasing behavior. Higher discounts often correlate with increased quantities ordered, though 
            excessive discounts show diminishing returns, highlighting the need for strategic pricing.
        </p>

        <h2>Interactive Features</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard includes interactive filters that enable users to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze specific categories (e.g., Entertainment, Computing, Mobiles & Tablets).</li>
            <li>Focus on specific demographics by filtering by gender, age group, or region.</li>
            <li>Adjust the time range to identify seasonal patterns or trends over the years.</li>
        </ul>
