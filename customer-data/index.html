        <h3>2. Revenue Distribution Across States</h3>
        <p>
            A detailed heatmap visualizes revenue contributions by state, uncovering regional strengths and gaps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>States like <strong>California</strong>, <strong>Texas</strong>, and <strong>New York</strong> stand out as consistent revenue generators.</li>
            <li>In contrast, states such as <strong>Alaska</strong> and <strong>Vermont</strong> show limited market penetration, potentially due to smaller populations or lower demand.</li>

        <h3>3. Monthly Revenue Trends</h3>
        <p>
            The Month-Wise Revenue Chart provides a clear view of revenue fluctuations over time, revealing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant spikes in <strong>December</strong>, driven by holiday shopping and promotional campaigns.</li>
            <li>Lulls in <strong>January</strong> and <strong>July</strong>, highlighting off-peak periods.</li>

        <h3>5. Gender-Wise Sales Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Bar charts break down revenue contributions by gender across categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Female customers</strong> drive sales in <strong>Women’s Fashion</strong> and <strong>Beauty & Grooming</strong>, as expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Male customers</strong> dominate in <strong>Mobiles & Tablets</strong> and <strong>Appliances</strong>, reflecting differing purchasing priorities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Tailor marketing campaigns and promotions to leverage these gender-specific trends, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty.</p>

        <h3>6. Age-Wise Revenue Contributions</h3>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>30–40 age group</strong> emerges as the most significant contributor, reflecting their higher purchasing power and spending habits.</li>
            <li><strong>Younger (<20 years)</strong> and <strong>older (>50 years)</strong> demographics contribute less but may represent untapped potential with the right targeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Actionable Insight:</strong> Develop targeted marketing strategies to engage younger customers and incentivize spending among older demographics.</p>

        <h3>7. Impact of Discounts on Quantity Ordered</h3>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Moderate discounts lead to increased purchases.</li>
            <li>However, excessive discounts show diminishing returns, signaling a need for balanced pricing strategies.</li>
