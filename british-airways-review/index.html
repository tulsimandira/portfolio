        <h2>The Challenge: Understanding the Voice of the Customer</h2>
        <p>
            British Airways, like any global airline, faces the challenge of meeting the diverse needs of its customers.
            Travelers leave reviews that reflect their experiences, from praises for attentive staff to complaints about uncomfortable seats or poor in-flight entertainment.
            These reviews hold the key to understanding how the airline can improve, but the sheer volume of data makes it hard to pinpoint trends and insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was born from a desire to turn raw customer feedback into a clear, actionable story. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard
            that uncovers the hidden patterns in customer reviews, helping British Airways make data-driven decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>The Journey: Building the Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            To tell the story of British Airways' customer satisfaction, I analyzed reviews from March 2016 to October 2023,
            focusing on key metrics that travelers care about most:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cabin staff service</li>
            <li>Entertainment</li>
            <li>Food and beverages</li>
            <li>Seat comfort</li>
            <li>Value for money</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The result? An interactive dashboard that gives stakeholders the power to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spot trends over time.</li>
            <li>Compare customer ratings across regions, traveler types, and seat classes.</li>
            <li>Understand which aircraft models delight passengers—and which fall short.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h2>Interactive Exploration: Putting the Power in Your Hands</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard isn’t just a static report—it’s a tool that allows stakeholders to explore the data in their own way. Want to know how business travelers feel about seat comfort? Or how family leisure travelers rate food and beverages? The interactive filters make it easy to dive deep:

            <li><b>Adjust the Time Range:</b> See how ratings have evolved over the years.</li>
            <li><b>Filter by Traveler Type:</b> Compare ratings for business travelers vs. solo leisure passengers.</li>
            <li><b>Drill Down by Aircraft or Region:</b> Pinpoint issues with specific planes or geographic markets.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><b>Address Regional Challenges:</b> Tailoring services to underperforming regions can boost satisfaction and customer loyalty.</li>
