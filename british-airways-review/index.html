        <h1>British Airways Review Dashboard</h1>
        <p class="lead">Comprehensive customer feedback analysis for British Airways from March 2016 to October 2023.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of customer feedback and reviews for British Airways from March 2016 to October 2023.
            Built using Tableau, it visualizes customer ratings across various categories, such as overall satisfaction, cabin staff service, food, entertainment, and seat comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders in the airline industry identify trends, strengths, and improvement opportunities
            by offering detailed insights into ratings by month, traveler type, region, and aircraft.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze overall and category-specific ratings to understand customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Explore trends over time to identify seasonal variations or recurring challenges.</li>
            <li>Compare geographic regions to pinpoint areas requiring targeted service improvements.</li>
            <li>Evaluate aircraft performance to identify models that excel or need attention.</li>
            <li>Empower stakeholders with interactive filters to customize and deep dive into specific metrics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Dashboard Breakdown</h2>
        <h3>1. Key Metrics</h3>
        <p>Displays the average ratings for each category based on customer reviews:</p>
        <ul>
            4.2: Overall Rating</li>

        <p>
            <b>Insights:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Entertainment, food, value for money, and seat comfort are rated the lowest, highlighting critical areas for improvement.</li>
                <li>Cabin staff service, while above average, still has room for enhancement.</li>
                <li>The overall score of 4.2 suggests mixed satisfaction, with certain categories dragging the average down.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>2. Average Overall Rating By Month (Line Chart)</h3>
        <p>This chart visualizes how the overall customer rating has changed over time:</p>
        <p>
            <b>Insights:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Ratings are inconsistent, with visible fluctuations across months and years.</li>
                <li>Dips in ratings during specific periods could indicate seasonal challenges (e.g., delays during busy holiday seasons) or operational disruptions (e.g., flight cancellations or staff shortages).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>3. Average Overall Rating By Country (Map Visualization)</h3>
        <p>A geographic heatmap showing the average customer ratings by country:</p>
        <p>
            <b>Insights:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>High-performing regions (dark green) reflect strong service consistency or customer loyalty.</li>
                <li>Underperforming regions (light green) signal areas where the airline may face operational challenges, cultural mismatches, or unmet customer expectations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>4. Average Overall Rating By Aircraft (Bar Chart)</h3>
        <p>A horizontal bar chart compares the average customer ratings for different aircraft types alongside the number of reviews for each:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boeing 747-400 has the highest rating (4.7) but fewer reviews (97).</li>
            <li>Boeing 777 has a solid rating (4.4) with the highest number of reviews (263).</li>
            <li>A321 has the lowest rating (3.6), reflecting potential comfort or performance issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Insights:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Aircraft like the Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 787 consistently receive higher ratings, indicating positive customer experiences.</li>
                <li>Aircraft like the A321 and A319 underperform, suggesting the need for further investigation into passenger dissatisfaction (e.g., seating arrangements, onboard features).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>5. Interactive Filters</h3>
        <p>
            Interactive filters make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly. You can view visualizations by choosing each metric separately:

            <li><b>Time Range (March 2016 - October 2023):</b> Adjust the date range to analyze trends over specific periods.</li>
            <li><b>Traveler Type:</b> Segment ratings by traveler type (e.g., business, couple leisure, family leisure, solo leisure).</li>
            <li><b>Seat Type:</b> Filter by ticket class (e.g., business class, economy class, premium economy, first class).</li>
            <li><b>Aircraft Group:</b> Focus on individual aircraft models to compare performance.</li>
            <li><b>Continent:</b> Narrow down ratings by region.</li>
        </ul>
