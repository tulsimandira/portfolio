# British Airways Review

British Airways has long been a symbol of trust and luxury in air travel. Yet, like every airline, it faces its share of challenges in meeting the diverse expectations of its customers. What do passengers truly think of their experiences? What makes them choose British Airways repeatedly, and what pushes them toward alternatives? This project dives deep into the voice of the customer, uncovering insights hidden in years of reviews to tell a data-driven story about satisfaction, strengths, and opportunities for improvement.

## **Project Overview**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of customer feedback and reviews for British Airways from March 2016 to October 2023. Built using Tableau, it visualizes customer ratings across various categories, such as overall satisfaction, cabin staff service, food, entertainment, and seat comfort.

The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders in the airline industry identify trends, strengths, and improvement opportunities by offering detailed insights into ratings by month, traveler type, region, and aircraft.

## **Project Objectives**

- Analyze overall and category-specific ratings to understand customer satisfaction.
- Explore trends over time to identify seasonal variations or recurring challenges.
- Compare geographic regions to pinpoint areas requiring targeted service improvements.
- Evaluate aircraft performance to identify models that excel or need attention.
- Empower stakeholders with interactive filters to customize and deep dive into specific metrics.

## **Dashboard Breakdown**

### **1. Key Metrics**

The dashboard displays the average ratings across critical categories based on customer reviews. The overall rating is 4.2, reflecting a mix of satisfaction levels. Cabin staff service is rated at 3.3, showcasing the professionalism and friendliness of the airlineâ€™s crew. However, entertainment is rated at a disappointing 1.4, indicating a significant gap in meeting customer expectations in this area. Food and beverages score 2.4, highlighting the need for better meal quality and variety. Ground service scores 3.0, while seat comfort and value for money are rated at 2.9 and 2.8, respectively, suggesting these areas also require further attention to enhance the customer experience.

### **2. Average Overall Rating By Month (Line Chart)**

This chart visualizes how the overall customer rating has changed over time. Ratings show visible fluctuations across months and years, with dips during specific periods suggesting seasonal challenges, such as delays during peak travel seasons or operational disruptions like cancellations or staff shortages.

### **3. Average Overall Rating By Country (Map Visualization)**

The geographic heatmap illustrates customer satisfaction by country. Darker regions represent higher satisfaction levels, indicating consistent service quality and customer loyalty. In contrast, lighter regions highlight areas where operational challenges, cultural mismatches, or unmet customer expectations may exist, necessitating targeted service improvements.

### **4. Average Overall Rating By Aircraft (Bar Chart)**

The bar chart compares the average customer ratings for different aircraft types alongside the number of reviews for each. The Boeing 747-400 has the highest rating at 4.7, though it has fewer reviews (97). The Boeing 777, with the highest number of reviews (263), scores 4.4, indicating consistent customer satisfaction. In contrast, the A321 has the lowest rating of 3.6, suggesting potential issues with cabin comfort or design that require further investigation.

### **5. Interactive Filters**

Interactive filters make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly. Users can view visualizations by choosing specific metrics such as food, entertainment, or seat comfort. Filters for time range (March 2016 to October 2023), traveler type (e.g., business, leisure), seat type (economy, premium, business class), aircraft group, and region allow stakeholders to dive deep into tailored insights, enabling more precise decision-making.

## **Key Findings**

- **Entertainment and Food Are the Weakest Areas:** Ratings of 1.4 and 2.4 highlight significant dissatisfaction in these areas.
- **Aircraft Performance:** Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 777 excel in ratings, while A321 and A319 underperform.
- **Geographic Variations:** Tailoring services to underperforming regions could improve satisfaction.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Seasonal dips in ratings suggest challenges during peak times.
